"Normal"

"normal" allow you to persist data not only just persistent
normal is attached to pod, so if pod is deleted so is volume
defined and created with pod

hard to use on global level so not often used for production -
because you have to go into individual pods to setup manually
persistent volumes...



"Persistent Volumes"

Not attached to a Pod

Can create the persistent volume using host-pv.yaml and then shared amongst different
pods using persistent volume claim (host-pvc.yaml). Can be defined once and used
multiple times.
