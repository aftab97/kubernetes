Kubernetes volumes are more powerful then docker volumes:
 1. supports many different drivers and types
    - can decide which hard drive to store on or use a aws service provider to store 
 2. Volumes are not persistent by default. Docker volume data is persisted.
 

You can specify volumes to connect to nfs (network file storage system), csi etc...

CSI:
Allows you to work with different cloud providers file storage systems (EBS, EFS, )

Hostpath:
allows for persistent volumes but when working with AWS etc it does not help anymore because
now you have multiple nodes and pods. Therefore the we require persistent volumes. PV claim
