Most cases you dont want multiple container per pod.
However if tightly coupled or they interact heavily with each other then you want them in seperate pods.

CluterIP: an IP which connects containers in one Pod

All pods needs services
    - gives stable IP addresses even when internally used in one pod


Pods can connect with each other in 3 ways: 
    - manually searching IP 
     >> users-deployment.yaml
        env:
        - name: AUTH_ADDRESS
        value: "10.99.104.252"

    - using automatically generated env variables
        e.g. users-service.yaml

            name: users-service
        
        This will be turned into: (capitals and dash changed to underscore and + _SERVICE_HOST)
        process.env.USERS_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST

        NOTE:
        In docker / docker-compose, the env is not automatically created so you have to setup yourself
        e.g. docker-compose.yaml

        services:
         users:
          build: ./users-api
          environment:
           AUTH_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST: auth
    
    - CoreDNS
        This comes with kubernetes and creates automatically gen domain names inside your cluster
        e.g. name: auth-service --> "<service name>.<default>"
        
         >> users-deployment.yaml
        env:
        - name: AUTH_ADDRESS
        value: "auth-service.default"
