Pods have an internal IP by default -it changes when a pod is replaced

Services group pods with a shared IP & can allows external access to Pods
    - kubectl expose deployment first-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
        - --type=LoadBalancer: distributes traffic evenly amongst the pods (EKS / minkube)
        - kubectl get services //can see IP and other info
        - minikube service first-app //gives me IP fo access the POD

Why Create Service First?
Good practice is to create service first as it is continously is running after
creation and monitoring which pods are made. As long as it matches the label 
selector. 

e.g.
selector:
    app: second-app

As long as it matches that the service will keep monitoring the new pods created

Why Service? :
Allow for static IP address 
Allows to connect from outside 

Get Service IP? :
kubectl apply -f=users-service.yaml
minkube service users-service
