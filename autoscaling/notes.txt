Kind: HorizontalPodAutoScaler

can set the spec min and max to what you require:
spec:
  maxReplicas: 5
  minReplicas: 1


CPU Average Percentage: 

    targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70

This will make sure the replicas will increase / decrease so that average CPU
percentage across is 70% (min 63% and max 77%)


How to target what you are scaling:

  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: app-tier

Debugging:
kubectl describe -n deplyment hpa //hpa short hand for horizontal pod autoscaler
OR
watch -n 1 kubectl get -n deployment deployment

serverside debugging:
kubectl edit -n deployment hpa
