This how you can add an env variable:
in the deployment.yaml:
          env:
            - name: STORY_FOLDER
              value: 'story'


and in the app.js:
process.env.STORY_FOLDER

However better solution to this would be rather then use a config map so that mupltiple containers can use it form one place.
